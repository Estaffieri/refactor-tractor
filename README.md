# Refactor-Tractor: FitLit

In this project we refactored an existing project with an emphasis on:
- Test Driven Development
- SCSS
- Fetch requests to GET and POST
- Dry, well organized javascript code

The details of the original FitLit project are outlined in the [Turing project page](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html).

## Set Up 
After cloning down the repo, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` to view the app.

## Goals & Objectives
- Build on top of pre-existing code that you did not write and navigate someone elseâ€™s codebase
- Develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests to perform effective code reviews that help ensure the code is accurate and that everyone understands it
- Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
- Ensure the app is following best practices for accessibility
- Leverage Sass to DRY up the CSS
- Incorporate Webpack to streamline the workflow process
- Leverage Chai Spies to verify that DOM manipulation is happening

## Future Iterations
We did not successfully implement DOM testing via chai spies, although our attempts are still documented in the project testing files.  This is an area for growth in future projects.

## Successes and Growth
This project successfully:
- Reorganized existing JS classes to refactor logic and methods
- Implemented fetch requests to GET data from the api and allow users to POST data through forms that we added
- Used scss to improve and reorganize our css file
- Utilized scss to improve UX/UI
- Achieved an accessibility score of 100%
